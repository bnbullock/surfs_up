# Surf's Up

## Project Overview
In order to determine if a "Surf and Shake Shop" can be a successful venture an investor has asked for data analysis to be provided for the weather on the Hawaiin island of Oahu. A SQLite dataset was provided with the necessary data to run the desired analytics. With a sound business plan already in place, it is imperative that the weather statistics be examined carefully to convince investors to support this personal venture. The concern right now is whether the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round or a more seasonal endevour based on the weather. With this goal in mind we are tasked with retrieving more information about temperature trends on Oahu for the months of June and December. We will make a comparative analysis and provide information and charts with the results.


- Deliverables:
  1. Retrieve all datapoints for June and provide a statistical summary.
  2. Retrieve all datapoints for December and provide a statistical summary.

## Resources
- Data Source(s) : hawaii.sqlite weather history data
- Software: Python 3.7.10, Visual Studio Code 1.56.2, Jupyter Notebook Server 6.3.0, SQLAlchemy

- Difference 2
- Difference 3


## Overall Summary

- it looks like the temparature range is between 60°F in the winter to - 90 °F (32 °C) or drop below 60 
- There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
